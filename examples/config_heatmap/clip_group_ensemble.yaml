  instance_descriptions:
    invasive cancer region:
      - high cell density with minimal spacing between cancer cells
      - significant nuclear pleomorphism with varying nuclear sizes
      - invasive margins visible, with cancer cells extending into surrounding tissues
      - increased mitotic figures indicating active cell division
      - disordered arrangement of cancer cells with chaotic structure
    immune tissue:
      - presence of extensive lymphocyte infiltration
      - densely packed lymphocytes, small and round cells
      - presence of macrophages and plasma cells in some areas
      - pinimal interstitial space with tight cell spacing
      - small, dense nuclei with minimal pleomorphism
    stromal Region:
      - proliferation of fibrous tissue with numerous fibroblasts
      - abundant collagen fibers within the stroma
      - numerous blood vessels with uniform vessel wall thickness
      - low cell density with wide cell spacing
      - diverse cell morphology including fibroblasts and a few immune cells
  stain_descriptions:
    minimal staining:
      - very faint blue nuclei and almost no discernible brown staining on the cell membranes
    incomplete brown staining:
      -  incomplete boundaries on some cell membranes.
    noticeable brown staining:
      - nearly all cell membranes completely surrounded and stained with high intensity.
  bag_descriptions:
    HER2 Score 0:
    - no staining, or membrane staining in < 10 % of tumor cells that is incomplete
      and faint / barely perceptible
    HER2 Score 1 +:
    - incomplete membrane staining that is faint / barely perceptible and involves
      > 10 % of tumor cells
    HER2 Score 2 +:
    - complete membrane staining that is weak / moderate and involves > 10 % of tumor
      cells, or intense staining in < 10 % of tumor cells
    HER2 Score 3 +:
    - strong and complete membrane staining in > 10 % of tumor cells
